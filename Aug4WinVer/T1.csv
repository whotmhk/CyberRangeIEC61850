10.2.1,10.2.1 The CIIO shall ensure that the OT CII is not connected to any enterprise network except where necessary for operating the CII and provided that the direction of data flows is restricted to only one-way from the OT CII to the enterprise network.  ,Options
10.2.2 ,10.2.2 The CIIO shall monitor the data flows from the OT CII to any enterprise network for anomalies and trigger an alert for investigation when any anomaly is detected.  ,Options
10.2.3,10.2.3 The CIIO shall implement separate authentication mechanisms and account credentials for users of the OT CII network and any enterprise network. This is to prevent threat actors from using compromised credentials across different operating environments.  ,Options
10.2.4,10.2.4 The CIIO shall ensure that the OT CII has fail-safes to ensure the safety and reliability of operations in the event of a cybersecurity incident. ,Options
10.2.5,10.2.5 The CIIO shall identify physical processes controlled by the OT CII and shall,Options
10.2.5 (a),10.2.5((a) Establish a baseline tolerance level for the operation time taken by the physical processes; ,Options
10.2.5 (b),10.2.5 (b) Monitor the duration of physical processes for deviations from the baseline tolerance level; and  ,Options
10.2.5 ?,10.2.5 (c) Ensure the field controller controlling the physical processes operate in a failsafe state when deviations outside of the tolerance level occur and trigger an alert for investigation.  ,Options
10.2.6,10.2.6 The CIIO shall ensure that the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) is only connected to authorised field devices1. This is to protect the SIS and its functions from being compromised in the event of a cybersecurity incident affecting other computers or computer systems. ,Options
10.2.7,"10.2.7 The CIIO shall periodically assess whether it is possible to replace CII assets (including legacy assets) with more secure versions, and make such replacements where possible to improve the cybersecurity of the CII. ",Options
