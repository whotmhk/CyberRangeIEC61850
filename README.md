# CyberRangeIEC61850
This is a MSSD thesis on " Cyber Range of Critical Infrastructure for Cybersecurity Experiment" 2024


There are 2 version in this repository
1. Is the linux version (which is fully tested with ubuntu 22.4.3 with lots more options, though some options would rquired to have input administrative password to execute).
2. The other is the windows version (which required Administrative priviliage to run, though it can be set up in the tasks but it is tedious)

#Concepts of the CyberRange
Both the Linux and Windows version are that both intended to allow testers/users to conduct stepwise simulation.
Depending on the setup, the network diagram will provide good indication and connection of the simulated environment setup.
First, gathered information (for windows -use the IEDExplorer/ObjectInfo), for linux use the ObjectInfo
to find out the Logical Devices and Logical Nodes info for further experimentation later.
